In this world where everything *looks* free, why do I sell some of my content?

When I began to write for [The Valuable Dev](https://thevaluable.dev), 5 years ago, it was clear for me that I didn't want to monetize anything: I hate advertisements, and I didn't want the lure of gain to cloud my judgments and influence my choices. I just wanted to keep my main goal in mind at all time: creating in depth articles I would have loved to read myself. Trying to help developers all over the world as much as I could.

The Valuable Dev will always be free, without any advertisement, affiliate link, sponsor, or anything which could influence the vision I have. The only things which drive my writing are the comments, questions, and feedback of my readers.

Unfortunately, I have little time to write for it. I need to pay the bills, so I need to spend most of my time working for startups to fulfill their main goal: making money.

I don't care about big cars, big flats, or even big computers; mine is 10 years old and works fine. The "rich and famous" lifestyle doesn't attract me at all, or I would have chosen a different path. But I would love to be able to write better articles to help even more, to write nice CLI tools which could make our life easier, to make more (and better) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoJtk2M8bme9KXTe6F3K-Yg), or to [write books](https://themouseless.dev/).

When you buy one of my product, you give me *time* to spend on my free content. From the bottom of my heart: thank you!
