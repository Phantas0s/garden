As Einstein famously said:

```
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
```

I was kidding you. It wasn't Einstein. Stop believing everything you're reading on The Internet.

## The Creative Process: Fun, Pain, Fear

I wanted to end this series of article by this simple idea: anything you'll try to create in this world will be a mix of fear, fun, and pain. The result will be either success, or regret.

Failure is not part of it. Failure doesn't exist. It's only learning: you'll get slower, you'll get feedback why you're slower, and you'll end up with some clues what to do next.

## Fun

Any creative process will include some fun. It might be bigger at the beginning, but if you really truly like what you're doing in general, it will never entirely disappear. That's why it's important to know if you like what you're doing enough to reach success. How do you know that? You need to try, to get some feedback.

## Pain

At one point, you'll have the impress that you don't have fun anymore. Everything is a chore. Everything looks hideous. The pain will be discrete at the beginning, and then it will accumulate. You'll ask yourself more questions, until you hit the wall.

## The Wall

The wall can be everything and anything, but it will stop you. This wall is powerful, and hard to break; you'll need to break it, however.

The wall can be:

* The fear of failure: I'm not good enough, what I'm doing is not good enough, nobody care.
* The fear of success: people seem to care. What if I deceive them? What will happen if many people see the monstrosity I'm building?
* The imposter syndrome: I'm not worthy building this thing. It will never work anyway, I'll never achieve my goal. It's not for me.

The wall will be different for everybody, but if you have some experience you'll recognize it. That is, to have some experience, you need to break it. At least once. You need to push hard: against you, sometimes against the opinion of others. It's like being deeply in the mud but still trying to run: it's exhausting, it's a fight, but you need to do it.

The ultimate goal: accepting the wall, instead of fearing it. Knowing that it will come, that it's here, and that's fine. That's part of the process. Buckle up, try to gather your strength, and continue building.

## Success or Regret

The wall can lead you to two very different result: you abandon your project, you feel like a fraud even more, and you regret it. It will be even harder to get through the wall the next time, because you lack the experience to go through it; it's a vicious circle.

If you go through the wall, you'll reach success. That is, you'll reach my definition of success: you created something, it might have some results, but it doesn't really matter. You learned a ton, you're ready for the next creation, and you know you'll enjoy it. Your knowledge about the wall will be better to, so you'll see it coming, you'll have more reflex and fortitute to go against it, and maybe, mayble you'll begin to have less fear. Maybe you'll begin to accept it.

## It's Not Easy

Creating anything worth is never easy. Forget the get rich quick and other scam: you have no way to know if what you're building will have any monetary result, and monatery result is not enough to go through the wall. As I told you, you need to experiment, and then focus on what interest you the most.

For the result of your creation in the real world, I deeply believe that it's mostly luck. Except if you have million of dollars to burn in advertising, most people (even the ones who might be interested in your craft) will never hear about you and what you're doing.

That's fine. Happiness is not only the concatenation of positive experiences. Why would people climb mountains, if fun, pain, and fear wasn't part of the equation? If they weren't there for us to accept them, to deal with them, and to succeed?
