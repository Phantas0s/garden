* Worked a bit on my OOS projects: DevDash and my custom Arch Linux installation scripts.
* Began a new blog and publish my first article about the [basics of grep](https://themouseless.dev/posts/grep-basics-mouseless/).

* Writing for my new blog The Mouseless Dev 😅
* I'll record my second video about Awk
* I've an interview for a company. I didn't even apply... I'm still not sure going into freelancing because of COVID. Let's see how it goes.
* I try to develop a new habit: reading computer science every evening before sleeping. My sleep was super good after some good old graph theory 🤣
