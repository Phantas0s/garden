I love learning by reading books. It's easier to find good ones thanks to reviews. If you need a more superficial and faster overview, articles can help, but how do you know they're accurate?

Technical tests: having somebody looking above your shoulder and judging if you're a 'good' developer based on his (or her) believes. What does it prove? Not much.

If you're wondering what's these distributed systems everybody's talking about (or if you want to refresh your knowledge), here's an excellent talk from @lvh explaining the 101 of distributed system. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAFGQurdJ3U #sundaytalk #development

Technical interviews: random questions in a very large set of questions. What are the odds you know the answers?

## 2021-01-11

Technical interviews are the best way to recruit somebody who thinks exactly like you. The result? The collective intelligence of your team will stagnate. Diversity will increase it.

It's not because Davina doesn't know X she's not a good developer. She might have forget. She might be so good she developed a strong intuition without the need of the details. It might be the expert blind spot. It might be muscle memory.

## 2021-01-13

I'm curious: what do you think about technical interviews? Technical tests? Did you see better ways to hire developers?

## 2021-01-14

Payed trial days to hire developers will show you how they work in your team, in your business domain. Too expensive? How much cost a developer who's not a fit?

For the first steps of a hiring process, looking at candidates' side projects should be enough. If they don't have any, a simple discussion can give you already a good idea if the candidate fits.

The hiring process can show you, as a developer, if the company will fit your needs. Here are my thoughts: https://thevaluable.dev/find-best-software-developer-job/

## 2021-01-16

I've spend countless hours working on technical assignments during hiring processes in 10+ years. Proper feedbacks were scarce. If they don't value your time, do you really want to work with them?

## 2021-01-17

Intelligence is a concept we speak about all the time. We value it as the holy Grail in western societies. We judge and we are judged by it. Still, nobody agrees on its definition.

## 2021-01-17

Here's a very nice talk from @mjpt777 who shares his thoughts about how to be a better engineer. Let's improve the industry by improving ourselves! https://www.infoq.com/presentations/engineer-practices-techniques/ #development #programming #sundaytalk

Hiding our weaknesses won't make us stronger. It will just mess up our mental health. We're all humans. We all do mistakes. You're not alone.

Next article on my blog (end of January): the imposter syndrome. What would you like me to write about? How can I help you?

## 2021-01-20

Developers are asked to know more and more, and to perform faster and faster. But health is the most important asset we have, including mental health. We need to take great care of it before anything else.

Here are some articles you might find useful on the subject: https://thevaluable.dev/tags/mental-health/

I've had 30 000 visitors on my blog in December 2020. Thanks for everybody following my work, thanks for your feedbacks (good or bad), thanks for the time you've spent reading it. I would love to get to know you all.

Even if my writing has more and more success, there is something which doesn't change: if only one person in the world find one of my article useful, I will always consider it a great achievement. Dear reader, I'm happy I could help you.

I believe that the SOLID principles try to oversimplify deeper ideas. It's a good example of an abstraction which generalise too much.

I've revisited some months ago the Single Responsibility Principle, trying to clarify where it comes from and why so many developers misunderstand it. https://thevaluable.dev/single-responsibility-principle-revisited/

Being good at something and being good at teaching something are two different skillsets. For the later, you need to know what the learner knows already, what he doesn't, what he (or she) needs to learn to accomplish his (or her) goal.

## 2021-01-24

The code you write is a first draft. At the beginning, your knowledge is limited. More you'll work for a given business domain, more your knowledge will grow. You need then to rewrite your drafts to include this updated knowledge. This is called refactoring.

You can get your code right the first time, but it's very rare. Don't let the analysis paralysis get you and write some code. You can always change it later.

It doesn't mean that you should rush to write your code. Thinking about and preparing your design is important. You need to strike a balance.

## 2021-01-25

Don't argue for too long. If you can't prove your point with solid data or good examples, write somewhere the discussion you had and wait to have these arguments. If you never find them, or if your worries never happen, you were probably wrong.

 The goal is not to be right or wrong anyway, it's to find the best solution. In that case there is no fight, no right or wrong, and you always move forward.

## 2021-01-26

Communication is mostly about listening. Try not to guess what you're buddies will say, don't cut them, be patient. Write your arguments if you're afraid to forget them. Try to really understand what they mean before giving your point of view.

## 2021-01-27

A reminder: the DRY principle has never been about code duplication, but about duplication of knowledge. These are two different things.

I've written about it a while ago if you want to know more. Even better: read The Pragmatic Programmer. https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/

## 2021-01-28

I find the concept of abstraction fascinating. We speak about it all the time as developers, yet I'm not sure we always understand it fully.

I would define it like this: an abstraction is meant to hide useless details to bring out more useful ones in a precise context.

## 2021-01-29

If you're working on the wrong product, a perfect codebase won't make it good. Coding is a mean to an end, not the end itself.

## 2021-01-30

Beginners often ask what language they should learn first. My answer: it doesn't really matter. Just pick a modern language like Ruby, Python, PHP, or Golang for example.

If you're searching a job, look at the job offers you might be interested in, and look at the language they ask for.

Some communities prefer some languages than others, often because of the libraries available. Example: python for data analytics.

When developers answer this question, you'll get a subjective answer. For example, notice that I didn't include JavaScript in my examples: I'm afraid that the language has too many traps for beginners. But it's a subjective opinion, and it should be taken with a grain of salt.

You might not agree with everything said during this talk, but it will be thought provoking anyway: ladies and gentlemen, Alan Kay at the UIUC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmTSpJU-Xc #sundaytalk #development #honestalankay
