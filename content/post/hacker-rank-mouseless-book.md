For what it's worth, I think there is a lot of space between what you use and what might work for other people. It's not that there is anything wrong with Arch. Rather Ubuntu is probably easier for many people. The general idea here is Linux.

Similarly, there are several tiling window managers. A neutral description of the options and links to resources might have broader appeal. Text editors are another place where the right tool varies among people.

I guess what I am getting at is "highly opinionated" is better suited for ongoing processes than it is for soft goals. Arch Linux is highly opinionated. This makes reasoning about the ongoing process of maintaining a Linux installation consistent. The strong opinions of Arch Linux are orthogonal to the goal of switching to a tiling window manager. Ubuntu has a different way of reasoning about system maintenance that might offer less friction for other people. Tiling window managers are not dependent on distribution.

I'm not trying to change your opinion. Rather, I think that there are ways to make the book a more useful resource for more people by broadening it to "here's how I do it and here are some other ways that might work better for you."

Good luck.

If I simplify a bit, I see two different approaches:

1. You write something broad as you say. You present many options to the reader. The book is not practical anymore, because you don't speak about something in particular but some general ideas. As a result, the readers can't really practice with a concrete project, and they might end up lost in an ocean of links. If I wanted to do that, I would have created another "Awesome list of Linux tools" on GitHub.

2. You write something more focused, as I did: the readers can practice, you can describe and explain everything they're doing because the focus is more narrow. You eliminate a whole class of problems as well, because you know exactly the tools they're installing and using. As a result, you enable them to understand what's happening.

I went for the second solution, because I think we lack books which are really practical. I wanted the reader to be actively engaged into a project, learn by practicing, and be able to swap every tool they want afterward. Because they'll have a deeper understanding of Linux, a modal editor, a tiling window manager, and so on.

It's not because I use these tools that I want to impose them to the world. I choose these tools for the book because they allow the reader to understand what's happening under the hood. Even if I was using another wm or another distro, I still would go with these tools, because it allows me to teach what I want to teach. Because they're not too difficult for beginners if you explain them right. I think people are smart, and I think they can learn way easier than most people think.

To me, Ubuntu is highly opinionated. Who cares? It's not about me, it's about what the readers can learn from the experience. I'm not convinced you learn a lot by installing Ubuntu, or that you understand the benefits to work with a tiling manager, or you understand the important place of the shell in the Linux ecosystem.
