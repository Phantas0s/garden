Still here for the third part of my rambling about the book I've written [Building Your Mouseless Development Environment](https://themouseless.dev/)? You're courageous, with a lot of patience. You'll go far in life my friend.

## The Million Dollar Idea

It's end 2019. We were all young and innocent at the time, full of hope and dreams. I was feeling quite bad, too, 'cause I didn't travel for a while.

If I stay at home, I'll be on my 12093210879123 side projects, focused like a laser. Travelling is the only thing which allow me to unfocus, to get creative again. On top of that: I love it so, so much. I could write a whole poem about it, but I think I shouldn't, for our sake. Ah! Travelling <3

We had a plan, with my girlfriend: quit our jobs and go backpacking in Asia for 4 to 6 months. While dreaming about the trip (more than preparing it, I like improvising sometimes), I had an idea.

At that point, my development environment was entirely based on Arch Linux (by the way) and CLI tools. Before that, I used Windows from 98 to 7, Ubuntu, Peppermint (a Linux distro based on Ubuntu), other Linux distro I forgot the names, and even MacOS.

When some colleagues showed me the power of tiling windows manager, Vim, and many other CLIs, I didn't believe that they could work with these horrible, old, and unpractical stuff. Then, I tried it. Seriously.

I've been hooked since then.

So, end of 2019, I ask on the Holy Reddit: "Yo brothers! Is anybody interested to have a book describing how to create this kind of shell-centric environment, based on Arch Linux, Zsh, Vim, and Tmux?"

The answer: a big YES. It was easy, I was on the "command line" subreddit. To me, it was enough. I'll write a book again!

At that point, we were ready to go in our trip in Asia. We left Berlin, where we live, in January 2020, and you know what comes next: our good old friend COVID 19 hit. Hard.

## Pandemy!

We had to come back, my girlfriend and I, in March 2020. All the borders in Europe were closing at that point. But we didn't have a flat anymore, because we were subleasing it for a couple of months more. We managed, somehow, to end up in a temporary flat for two months. It's not like you can get a flat in Berlin super easily; but we managed.

No job, no way to finish our travel, no way to come back to our flat, with only my immortal Lenovo x220 laptop I was carrying around in Asia, and some clothes.

What a great time to write a book!

First, I had to decide what tools I'd use for that. Easy peasy lemon squeezy:

* Vim
* Pandoc
* Make

I knew Vim, not so much Pandoc, even less Make, and I had no idea about Latex. I've written the book in Markdown, but since I like to shape everything according to my craziest megalomaniac desire, I had to scribble some Latex, and more than once.

But I could do everything in my shell, and that's what matter.

And, you know, I'm on a computer for a long time. It didn't take me long to have a first setup to create a PDF, an EPUB, and even an HTML in one command line.

I don't try to know everything. There is too much stuff. But I try to be able to learn anything quickly. It's the whole goal of The Valuable Dev.

Anyway. That was the birth of my book!

## Luck, Luck, Luck, and Success

All and all, I was incredibly lucky. I wasn't alone, we found a flat quickly when we **had to** (never saw such a mess in airports, with so many flight cancelled), I didn't get COVID to this day, I could keep a positive spirit enabling me to write a book in a dark period, I'm living in a rich country, and I'm a privileged white male. It's not winning a lottery, it's winning a dozen of them.

So, what's success? Mostly luck. Of course, luck can be slightly helped: I love what I'm doing, so I do it long enough to get some fruits from the tree.

There is however a difference between my rational thinking above and my feelings, which do whatever the hell they want in my weird brain. I didn't let them take over, however, and that's what really mattered. Years of meditation help. It can help you too. Or something else.

You know. Try. Experiment. Fail. Learn. Try again.

Or just relax. We need to relax, sometimes. For me, it's travelling. For you, it might be something else. Be sure it makes you unfocus, though. We can't spend our time obsessed by what we want. By our goals. We need to taste the present, too.

The western world is so crazy with its quest of results, success, hustling, and productivity. Let's not forget: enjoying the way, focusing on higher goals, wondering, relaxing. Creating something without any expectations. Helping without expectations.

It might not be the direct way to achieve what you want, but indirect ways are often the best ways. Most of life is about the way. Whatever we do, we'll try to do better anyway. We'll try another way.

Did I had some expectation for this book? One: I would be happy if it would help somebody. My expectations were blown away hundred of times.

Is it success, then?
