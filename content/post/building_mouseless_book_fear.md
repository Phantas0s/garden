So I was rambling, in the last post, that I love what I do. That's why I can do it long enough to get some interesting results. It's only one third of the Magical Recipe for Success as I Define Itâ„¢, though.

## The Recipe for Success

Here are the two other ingredients:

1. It's important to unfocus and relax. It's what makes me creative. It's not about trying to reach my goal directly, but in weird, twisted way. It's where more original ideas come.
2. It's important to focus to take action. To implement these ideas. Without actions, ideas are invisible and forgotten.

With these advice, you'll be rich in no time, the New York Time will speak about your infinite legacy, and you'll have three ghost writers fighting to write your memoirs. Guaranteed!

So, how should you focus? Well, I've my method I use for years, because it works. Will it work for you? I've no idea. Our brain are similar, yet different. But if you're interested, it's [there]().

## Writing

I love habits, and I understand more and more how I can work with them. I'm quite obsessive, so when some habits make their little nest in my sick brain, they're here to stay.

I write every day, for years. It's one of my strongest habit. If I miss a couple of days, that's fine; but I shouldn't miss too many. Discipline and consistency are important to focus. To take action. I try to nurture my habits.

When you've habits pushing you toward your goal, you'll get some good endorphin (or other weird chemical). You'll feel good about what you're doing; that you finally do what you want to do, without obeing your instincts or fear. You'll get some self-estime, which will, in return, help you to accomplish your goals.

I've written every day for my book till September 2020. Then, I hit something. A big rock in my face.

## The Fear of Success

Until then, everything was going smoothly: I was writing, sending newsletter every two weeks, listening to feedback as much as I could, fixing the biggest problems, and writing more.

I didn't see the fear crawling in.

But it hit me, suddenly: what if nobody likes this book? Am I good enough to write it? Will I mislead readers with bad advice? Will they lose their time? Will I cause harm? Will the majority of readers ask for a refund?

I wasn't afraid because of an eventual failure; if nobody gets the book, nobody would complains. I was afraid of success. I was afraid that people discover that I wasn't the one I said I was. That I didn't know obscure Linux trap I should have specified in the book. Maybe I wasn't good enough to write this book at the first place!

There was a dissonance between the way I was perceiving myself, and my actions. I didn't think I was able to write a book, and yet I was successfully writing a book. There are two things I could do from there: adjust the way I was perceiving myself (my identity), or sabotage what I was doing to save my identity.

If tomorrow I see a friend who has this fear creeping in, I would try to convince her that she shouldn't fear so much. "You know what you're doing! You're doing it for decades!". Or even: "whatever happen, you'll learn a lot!".

The problem: fear is an emotion, not a voluntary thought. It's difficult to use intellectual arguments to calm emotions. Even if we have all the possible pragmatic reasons to dismiss these fears, they would still be there. Maybe weaker for a time; but they would come back in force.

## Self Sabotage

So I stop writing. For weeks. I was watching Youtube video all day long, or playing video games. My fear was getting stronger, and my mindset was getting worst and worst. It was a stressful period, filled with disappointment; the easiest one to have, the one everybody experiences. The disappointment in oneself.

I wanted to write this book. I wanted to write books since the beginning of time. Yet, I was doing everything to convinced myself that I wasn't capable to do it. There are some forces inside us pushing us in many different directions; if one thing, it proved me again that human beings are far from being logical and rational. But at the end of the day, we need to find a way to come back to the track we want to pursue.

## External Help

One morning, I received an email. It was a developer who really wanted the book. The message was only praises after praises: he liked my blog a lot, he liked the table of content of the book, he liked everything. He trusted me to deliver the best book possible.

I focused on him. At least, one person might like this book. So I began to write again.

That's the key, right here: instead of focusing on you and your fear, focus on the people who trust you. Who wants what you can offer. Listen to them, speak to them, learn from them. Somehow, listening to our own emotion is something quite ego-centered. Listening to other needs, that's where we can really help and feel good about helping. The good kind of egotism.

## The Last Mile

I came back to writing. Every day. Soon, in January, my last draft was done. Next step: fixing my English.

If you're a native speaker, I'm sure you notice that English is not my mother tongue. I needed some serious proofreading, for my work not to feel to amateurish. I could have hired somebody of course, like I could have used a publishing house for the book. But I wanted a full control on my work; it has many drawbacks, but I was prioritizing my vision more than anything else.

I also wanted to keep the book in the community I've been created with my blog and my newsletter. That was the most important for me: the people who wanted this book. The ones who helped me beginning it, writing it, and finishing it.

So I asked in my newsletter if some native speakers would be interested to proofread the book. The reward: getting the whole book for free, as well as a mention in the acknowledgment at the beginning, with a link to whatever they wanted (blog, twitter account, and so on). The response was more than I expected: in two days, each chapter had some proofreader, and many others were ready to do the work if others abandoned. It allowed me to email great people who had super interesting backgrounds and ideas.

I finally released the book in February 2021.
