So I was saying, in the last post, that I love what I do, that's why I can do it long enough to get some results. It's only one third of the truth, though.

## The Recipe for Success

Here are the two other ingredients:

1. It's important to wonder and relax. It's important to unfocus. It's what makes you creative. It's what bring ideas.
2. It's important to focus to take action. To realize these ideas. To implement them. Without actions, ideas are invisible and forgotten.

With that, you'll be rich in no time, the New York Time will speak about your legacy, and you'll have three ghost writers for your memoirs. Guaranteed.

So, how should you focus? Well, I've my method I use for years, because it works. Will it work for you? I've no idea. Our brain are similar, yet different. But if you're interested, it's [there]().

## Writing

I love habits, and I begin to understand how I can work with them. I'm quite obsessive, so when some habit make their little nest in my sick brain, they're here to stay. It's when it will give me some good old endorphine (or whatever weird chemical) to tell me that I like it.

I write every day, for years. If I miss a couple of days, that's fine; but I shouldn't miss too many. Discipline and consistency are important to focus. To take action. I try to nurture my habits.

I've written every day for my book till September 2020. Then, I've hit something. A big rock.

## The Fear of Success

Until then, everything was quite smooth: I was writing, sending newsletter every two weeks, taking feedback, fixing, and writing more. I didn't see the fear crawling in. It hit me, suddenly: what if nobody like this book? Worst: am I good enough for writing this book? Will I mislead readers with my bad advice? Will they lose their time? Will I cause harm? Will the majority of buyers simply ask for a refund?

I wasn't afraid because of an eventual failure; if nobody buy this book, nobody would complain. I was afraid of succeeding. I was afraid that people discover that I wasn't the one I said I was. That I didn't know obscure Linux trap I should have specified in the book. That I didn't know something so simple, everybody knew it. As a result, I shouldn't have been entitled to write this kind of book.

If I would see, in another person, this kind of fear creeping in, I would try to convince them that they have no foundation: "you know what you're doing! You're doing it for decades!", or even "whatever happen, you'll learn a lot!".

The problem: fear is an emotion, not a voluntary thought. It's difficult to use reason to calm emotions. Even if we have all the pragmatic reason to dismiss these fears, they would still be there. Maybe weaker for a time; and then, the day after, they would come back in force.

So I stop writing. For weeks. I was watching Youtube video all day, or playing video games. My fear grew and grew, and my mindset was getting worst and worst. It was a stressful period, filled with disappointment, the easy kine: disappointed toward myself.

One morning, I received an email. It was a developer who really wanted the book. The message was only praises after praises: he liked my blog a lot, he liked the table of content of the book, he liked everything. He trusted me to deliver the best book possible.

I focused on him. At least, one person might like this book. So I began to write again.

That's the key, right here: instead of focusing on you and your fear, focus on the people who trust you. Who wants what you can offer. Listen to them, speak to them, learn from them. Somehow, listening to our own emotion is something quite ego-centered. Listening to other needs, that's where we can really help and feel good about helping. The good kind of egotism.

## The Last Mile

I didn't stop writing until February 2021, when I released the first part of the book.
