I'm a big fan of Hugo. I've three blogs / landing pages using it:

* https://themouseless.dev
* https://thevaluable.dev
* https://matthieucneude.com/garden

I've used tonnes of blog engines, including Ghost, wordpress, and others. Why I like Hugo:

1. It's a static site generator, which means that what's online is just plain HTML / CSS. Very secure (I look at you, wordpress. Favorite target of hackers this stuff).
2. No need to update an engine every two months with sweat and blood (that's why I went away from Ghost).
3. It's written with Golang, which is a very fast programming language. You can generate tonnes of pages very quickly.
4. You can overwrite any theme you want very easily.
5. Super simple to deploy on a github page (you need to know a bit git and Bash scripting though).
6. Super simple to deploy on a server using githooks.
7. Many free themes available: https://themes.gohugo.io/
8. Everything you write in plain text, no database and other moving parts which will crash in your sorry hands (markdown).
9. Super easy to extend the markdown with custom shortcode.

LOVE it!
