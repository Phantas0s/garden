## 2021-03-01

💫 Last Week:

* Spent a LOT of time writing for my blog.
* Read the chapter 4.1 of the SICP (the metacircular evaluator). Really cool stuff.
* Released my new blog article, and it had... way more success than I thought. So so happy and thankful about that! February is a blessed month for me 🥰
* Released a new video on my Youtube channel about sed.
* Reviewed some of my notes / mindmaps about writing, learning, and discrete maths.
* Continue to read "Introduction to General System Thinking".

🔨 This Week:

* Relaxing. I'll spend my time with my girlfriend who's in holiday
* ... I won't be able to resist the urge to write for my blog and continue my CLI for pocket 😇

💫 Last Week:

* I did a little break last week: hiking and watching movies. Didn't watch Jurassik Park for too long; that was great! Best quote ever: "your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should". Get them Ian!
* Wrote a LOT for my blog. Like... a lot.
* Finished the first version of my [CLI for pocket](https://github.com/Phantas0s/gocket). Feedback more than welcome!
* Reviewed some of my notes / mindmaps about writing.
* Almost done with [Introduction to General System Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583766.An_Introduction_to_General_Systems_Thinking). I love this book! I bought it two times (physical book + ebook) and I bought as well the two following books.

🔨 This Week:

* Writing for my blog. A lot. Again.
* Updating [my book](https://themouseless.dev) with a new chapter - a list of alternative tools you can use for a Mouseless Development Environment. I'll also add a few fixes and maybe a short paragraph on POSIX too.
* Coming back to the metacircular evaluator in the SICP.
* Trying to get done my second Youtube video about sed.
* I'm thinking to build a consultancy business (problem solving is so sweet 💖), which would be more like a freelance business at the beginning... in COVID time it will be a challenge, but difficult to say before trying.
* Doing and reviewing some mindmaps, as always.
