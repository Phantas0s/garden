I'll add here my weekly stand-up just to keep track of what I'm doing. I'm not sure it's super useful, so I might stop that at one point.

## 2021-02-15

üí´ Last Week:

* I released my book, the response was crazy. I expected three people interested by it, I was wrong, and it's awesome! I'm on a little cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è.
* I could work a bit more on Brian Harvey's courses (SICP). Week 12 on 16! I can make it!
* I wrote a bit for my blog.
* I reviewed some of my mindmaps (I try to do that every week).
* I've a lot of fun on my CLI for pocket. Their API is way better than I thought, so I have already good results (and a tonne of ideas I need to reject for the first versions :D)
* Read a bit "General System Thinking".

üî® This Week:

* Way more focus on my blog. I think people will like my next article (at least I hope).
* More focus on the SICP. I've a midterm! I'm always afraid of these ones, but at the same time they're really well made.
* I plan to make good progress on my pocket CLI.
* Since I always love to put too much on my plate, I've a new blog where I put my thoughts everything not fitting my other blog. I plan to put all my tweets in there (per month) to keep them safe.
* Mindmaps review.
* Continue to read "General System Thinking".
* Customer support for my book. I love to do that, I feel useful.

üí´ Last Week:

* I've spend a lot of time writing for my blog. I just need to fire up my grammar / syntax / wordiness tools, add an image or two, and my next article is ready.
* Fixed a lot of typo and added some troubleshooting for my book, based on the feedback of the readers.
* I've done my third midterm from Brian Harvey's SICP course. As always, barely above average, but this time I was pretty proud (didn't touch the book for 3 months). I remember quite a lot of stuff :)
* I'm mostly done with the CLI part for my Pocket app.
* Reviewed some of my notes / mindmaps about writing and discrete maths.
* Continue to read "Introduction to General System Thinking".

üî® This Week:

* I'll release today the first free update for my book.
* Reading and begin the exercises of week 13 from Brian Harvey's SICP course: the metacircular evaluator (love this name).
* Begin the next article for my blog.
* Reviewing my notes and mindmaps, like every week (about writing / learning / discrete maths).
* Take an hour or two to sort and post-process some photos.
* Continue my CLI / TUI for Pocket, hope to be done this week.
* Continue to read "Introduction to General System Thinking".
* Many calls / brainstorming sessions.

üí´ Last Week:

* Spent a LOT of time writing for my blog.
* Read the chapter 4.1 of the SICP (the metacircular evaluator). Really cool stuff.
* Released my new blog article, and it had... way more success than I thought. So so happy and thankful about that! February is a blessed month for me ü•∞
* Released a new video on my Youtube channel about sed.
* Reviewed some of my notes / mindmaps about writing, learning, and discrete maths.
* Continue to read "Introduction to General System Thinking".

üî® This Week:

* Relaxing. I'll spend my time with my girlfriend who's in holiday
* ... I won't be able to resist the urge to write for my blog and continue my CLI for pocket üòá

## 2021-03-08

üí´ Last Week:

* I did a little break last week: hiking and watching movies. Didn't watch Jurassik Park for too long; that was great! Best quote ever: "your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn‚Äôt stop to think if they should". Get them Ian!
* Wrote a LOT for my blog. Like... a lot.
* Finished the first version of my [CLI for pocket](https://github.com/Phantas0s/gocket). Feedback more than welcome!
* Reviewed some of my notes / mindmaps about writing.
* Almost done with [Introduction to General System Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583766.An_Introduction_to_General_Systems_Thinking). I love this book! I bought it two times (physical book + ebook) and I bought as well the two following books.

üî® This Week:

* Writing for my blog. A lot. Again.
* Updating [my book](https://themouseless.dev) with a new chapter - a list of alternative tools you can use for a Mouseless Development Environment. I'll also add a few fixes and maybe a short paragraph on POSIX too.
* Coming back to the metacircular evaluator in the SICP.
* Trying to get done my second Youtube video about sed.
* I'm thinking to build a consultancy business (problem solving is so sweet üíñ), which would be more like a freelance business at the beginning... in COVID time it will be a challenge, but difficult to say before trying.
* Doing and reviewing some mindmaps, as always.
