I'll add here my weekly stand-up just to keep track of what I'm doing. I'm not sure it's super useful, so I might stop that at one point.

## 2021-02-15

üí´ Last Week:

* I released my book, the response was crazy. I expected three people interested by it, I was wrong, and it's awesome! I'm on a little cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è.
* I could work a bit more on Brian Harvey's courses (SICP). Week 12 on 16! I can make it!
* I wrote a bit for my blog.
* I reviewed some of my mindmaps (I try to do that every week).
* I've a lot of fun on my CLI for pocket. Their API is way better than I thought, so I have already good results (and a tonne of ideas I need to reject for the first versions :D)
* Read a bit "General System Thinking".

üî® This Week:

* Way more focus on my blog. I think people will like my next article (at least I hope).
* More focus on the SICP. I've a midterm! I'm always afraid of these ones, but at the same time they're really well made.
* I plan to make good progress on my pocket CLI.
* Since I always love to put too much on my plate, I've a new blog where I put my thoughts everything not fitting my other blog. I plan to put all my tweets in there (per month) to keep them safe.
* Mindmaps review.
* Continue to read "General System Thinking".
* Customer support for my book. I love to do that, I feel useful.

üí´ Last Week:

* I've spend a lot of time writing for my blog. I just need to fire up my grammar / syntax / wordiness tools, add an image or two, and my next article is ready.
* Fixed a lot of typo and added some troubleshooting for my book, based on the feedback of the readers.
* I've done my third midterm from Brian Harvey's SICP course. As always, barely above average, but this time I was pretty proud (didn't touch the book for 3 months). I remember quite a lot of stuff :)
* I'm mostly done with the CLI part for my Pocket app.
* Reviewed some of my notes / mindmaps about writing and discrete maths.
* Continue to read "Introduction to General System Thinking".

üî® This Week:

* I'll release today the first free update for my book.
* Reading and begin the exercises of week 13 from Brian Harvey's SICP course: the metacircular evaluator (love this name).
* Begin the next article for my blog.
* Reviewing my notes and mindmaps, like every week (about writing / learning / discrete maths).
* Take an hour or two to sort and post-process some photos.
* Continue my CLI / TUI for Pocket, hope to be done this week.
* Continue to read "Introduction to General System Thinking".
* Many calls / brainstorming sessions.
