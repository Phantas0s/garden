Question of the day: how do you learn a new programming language?

I've described my own workflow on my blog - https://thevaluable.dev/how-to-learn-programming-language/. What about yours?

## 2021-02-02

Communicating efficiently with your teammates is really important if you want to deliver quality work. The best way to do so: listen as much as you can.

If you want to learn and improve, wait before throwing your opinion to your buddy: instead, ask questions.

## 2021-02-03

I often ask questions, even if I 'know' the answer. I just want to have another opinion, another point of view, without influencing it.

## 2021-02-04

More I know, more I understand that it's nothing compared to what I don't know. This is so exciting. I feel like a conqueror trying to find a path to new territories.

## 2021-02-05

Don't be too fast at judging others, instead try to understand why they act or think like they do. Like in code, going back to the root cause can bring surprising results, for everybody.

## 2021-02-06

You need to take everything you read and hear about development with a grain of salt, including what I'm advocating. When developer speak about truth, they only speak about beliefs. Experiment and see by yourself.

## 2021-02-07

You want to decrease the complexity of your software? Implement only the most important functionalities. Sounds easy? It's not. You'll need a lot of knowledge: what's the users want and how they want it. How can we get this knowledge?

## 2021-02-08

When Davina, your colleague developer, ask you something, it doesn't mean that she doesn't know. She might have already an idea and she just want to confirm it. Try this: ask her what she thinks about it first. You might learn something too.

## 2021-02-09

Humility will allow you to learn and improve. It doesn't mean that you need to undermine your own results: it's not humility, it's the imposter syndrome. Don't do that to yourself.

## 2021-02-10

Having high expectations for yourself can be positive, but only if you accept when you're not reaching them. Otherwise, you'll be often frustrated. Even worse: you might have the same expectations for the people around you, bringing toxicity for everybody.

## 2021-02-11

Studying by myself some computer science for hundred of hours opened the doors of computer science studies to me. I don't shy away from them anymore. I'm so happy to have access to this crazy amount of incredible knowledge.

Not only that: I see now software development in a new light, and I understand the importance to look in the past of our industry, not only looking at the trend. Chances are that these 'new discoveries' are not that new anyway.

It showed me as well that knowing the first principles makes everything built on top easier to learn.

You don't need to know some computer science to be a developer, but if you have at least one or two years of experience, if you're curious, and if you want to improve, I definitely suggest you to check it out.

Teach Yourself Computer Science is full of great references: https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming @oznova_ @quackingduck

## 2021-02-12

When you're reading a technical article on Wikipedia, look at the references. There are many studies and great resources in there which can teach you a lot.

In general, when you read an article, look at the referenced studies, if there are any. It will allow you to dig deeper if you want to.

## 2021-02-13

There are different ways to learn, and there are different levels of expertise you can reach. Ask yourself: do you need to dig deep in a topic to achieve your goals?

An example: if you want to write a PHP script to rename a bunch of pictures, you don't need to know everything PHP offers. If you're interested in learning, I wrote an article about it: https://thevaluable.dev/learning-developer-efficiently-effectively/

## 2021-02-14

I think we should invent a formal method to accuratly describe how a software will behave at runtime, to see what possible defects it will have and before these defects affect the end user.

Oh. Wait. Somebody's telling me that it exists already. It's... code. Yep. It's called code.

## 2021-02-14

This Sunday a fantastic talk from @AdamTornhill who explains in great details how to measure the quality of your codebase. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl4aZ2KXBsQ #sundaytalk #development

On top, collecting data is a great way to convince your managers that you need some time to refactor some legacy components...

## 2021-02-15

How many companies did you see going bankrupt because of a legacy system? I never saw any. What about a bad product or bad market fit? It's pretty common. In that case, why is everybody, in the software world, focusing so much on technology?

## 2021-02-16

Hiring processes will often select the candidates who have the same ideas, opinions, and knowledge than the interviewers. Yet, everybody wants to increase the diversity and the collective intelligence of their team. I think there is a problem somewhere.

## 2021-02-16

What's a type, in computer science? It's simply a set of value. The type 'int' is the set of integer. A class is a type, too; Bjarne Stroustrup invented the keyword to be able to create his own types.

As a result, the instances of the class 'duck' can be seen as elements of the type 'duck'.

## 2021-02-17

You might have heard that some languages are strongly typed, some are weakly typed.

These affirmations are subjective judgments. A language can be statically or dynamically typed, and a statically typed language is not automatically 'strong', as a dynamic typed language is not automatically 'weak'.

Both static typed and dynamic typed languages have their pros and cons in specific contexts, so here's what you should do: look at the type system of the language you're working with, and don't limit yourself with these blurry ideas of 'strong' and 'weak.

## 2021-02-18

Mathematics thrive to be as precise as possible, trying not to let space for ambiguity. We should try to do the same in software development.

Here are some examples of ambiguous concepts: the SOLID principles, the different paradigms, type systems ('strong' and 'weak'), good and bad code...

Software engineering can be considered as applied Mathematics. As such, I think ambiguity will always be part of our work, because the real world is ambiguous. But trying to refine the precision we need in a specific context can help us to *understand* each other.

LISP is one of the first high level language (after Fortran) which began to be specified in 1960. Here's what LISP included for the first time in a programming language:

Functions as first class citizen (code as data), recursion, conditionals (predicates), linked lists, garbage collection.

Since LISP is a metaprogramming language, you can extend the language easily using the language itself. That's why LISP has dialects; the most famous ones in use nowadays are Racket, Common Lisp, and Clojure.

If you're curious, McCarthy's paper (the inventor of LISP) discuss about these ground-breaking ideas: http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/recursive/recursive.pdf

## 2021-02-20

Be careful of the cognitive biases you can have! Some of them are well studied in software development, including the optimistic bias, the overconfidence bias, the confirmation bias, and the anchoring bias.

Here's a very interesting paper about the studies made about these biases: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328410759_Cognitive_Biases_in_Software_Engineering_A_Systematic_Mapping_Study

I've also written an article about that, where you'll find many different resources on the subject: https://thevaluable.dev/cognitive-bias-software-development/

## 2021-02-21

It's not because you're good at something that you can teach it well. If you're an expert, you will put behind useful abstractions a large amount of knowledge you won't be able to explain in details anymore.

This is called the expert blind spot. Some would call that 'intuition', 'chunking', or even 'internalizing knowledge'.

So the next time you'll explain a beginner something which looks obvious to you, try to explain it with as many details as you can, depending of the knowledge of the other person.

## 2021-02-21

Today is #sundaytalk! Here's a very nice presentation from @gar1t. Don't be fooled by the title: it's about refactoring, legacy code, how to improve your Bash scripts, and many other helpful advice for any developer out there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD2ekOEP9sU

## 2021-02-22

Why do we under-estimate every task? The optimistic bias. Asking questions can be a good way to debunk it.

For example: 'Can you see any reason why your solution might be wrong?', or 'Can you think about dependent features which are coupled to the one we modify?'

It will force people (including yourself!) to think about the difficult part instead of the easy one.

## 2021-02-23

Instead of comparing myself to the others, I try to imagine what my 10-years-old-past-self would have said to my current self. 'You've 100 people subscribing to your videos! That's so many! You're famous! When do we eat? I'm hungry! See ya, I'm going to finish this video game'.

## 2021-02-24

Goals are, to me, just something I try to tend to, not necessarily to accomplish. Tomorrow, my goals might not be appealing anymore. They might have mutated to something else.

It doesn't matter: I pick the way I enjoy the most, very often linked to my deepest purposes, and I'm happy with the process tending to my goals.

Life is not some sparse results, it's every single day. Try to enjoy them as much as you can, by doing what you really want to do.

Don't choose the way which might make you happy in 10 years: find a way you enjoy now AND which can compound for the future.

## 2021-02-25

The best way I found to fight procrastination: don't fight it.

We have many instincts, emotions, and urges our conscious self have difficulties to deal with. Try to accept them.

If you procrastinate, don't blame yourself, try to remove as many distractions as you can from your workplace, and accept that you're not perfect.

Instead, you need to find tricks to go around these impulses of fear linked to procrastination: for example, try to work for 10min on your important project and, if you don't enjoy it, stop and come back to it later.

## 2021-02-26

You can learn a lot by practicing, but it's not enough. If you only practice, you'll stay in your bubble of knowledge and misconceptions. You need to stay open to new ideas, especially the ones you disagree with, to expand your bubble.

Concretely, you should truly listen to the others and try to understand their ideas, reading a lot about very different subjects, and try to find inspiration in everything around you.

## 2021-02-27

There are three types of feedback: the first one tells you that you've made a mistake.

The second one tells you precisely what mistake you've made.

The third one tells you what mistake you've made and possible solutions to fix it, or even better: to prevent it.

The first one is useless, the second one is more useful, the third one is golden. Try to find the people who are genuinely happy to provide you the third type.

It's time for a #sundaytalk: this week, an amazing talk from @2braids about complexity and life. It's more than a talk, it's a live-music-talk-with-cliffhanger. It's wonderfully written, and it blew me away. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSfe5M_zG2s
