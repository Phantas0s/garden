Marketing is bad!

But wait.. What's marketing, exactly?

## Who Doesn't Know Marketing?

How many times did we hear of "marketing" in our life? A couple of billions? Difficult to forget that we're in a deep mercantil society, for sure. It doesn't matter: everybody speak about it, so let's try to define it.

I won't open a dictionary for that; dictionary don't have the absolute truth, even it's certainly useful in many occasion. And that's the key for dictionaries as well as marketing: the context. Truth change depending of what's around it.

Take Coca Cola. You know, the simple, familial mega-corporation largely responsible for worldwide plastic poluting (and trying for decade to escape the good population to think that's it's the truth). It's not like they produce 3 million tons of plastic per year, or [200 000 bottles a minute](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21076868/plastic-bottle-coca-cola-davos-world-economic-forum). I mean, who doesn't do that in the familial backyard?

Coca Cola has a notoriety level of 99%. It means that 99% of the world heard of the company. It's massive. Imagine the marketing they need to achieve that. We're looking at billion of dollars of ads here, in every possible way and form, from the student launching to the poor walkers their anti-rust ~~detergent~~ drink, to the TV spot, billboards, internet ads, sponsoring, weird [3D movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrAzq1-S5Y), and whatever else you can imagine.

When I see Coca Cola marketing, I want to burn it to the ground. I hate the company, and I hate that I see it everywhere. I never wanted hearing about them, I never wanted to drink their product, and god knows that I did drink their product. I was young once, even if it's not an excuse.

This is what many people have in mind when they think of marketing: annoying messages nobody asked for, from massive mega-corporation who try relentlessly to convince us that they're the good guys (or girls, evil has no gender) even if they'll bring us all down.

Now, let's come back to me. This series is about me and my book, after all, so let's be like the Instagram celebrities and focus on my little belly button. My marketing has nothing to do with Coca Cola of course, and many other companies for that matter. I'm alone, and I try to sell my book.

Thinking about it, we should invent a new word for what I'm trying to do. It's not "marketing". I don't target a market like a canon target civilians, I try to propose something I made with my sweat and blood to people who could be genuinely interested by it. People with their distinct needs and personality.

But to help these people, they need to know that this book exists at the first place.

So we went from annoying Coca Cola ads to a guy who try to show what he has done to people who might want it. Does it sound better? Well, I hope so, because if it wasn't I would stop selling these books right now.

What I'm trying to say here is that "marketing" (let's call it discoverability in my case, shall we?) is not a bad thing for small entities (I'm a small entity! Hurray!) who want to help. Of course, I've money to gain in the operation; but, ideally, it should be a win-win situation.

So let's stop saying that marketing is bad. It's bad for bad companies. It's bad when it's annoying. It's bad when it's not honest. But honest discoverability is something anybody who wants to show what they've done a straight necessity.

## Win-Win Situation

So, how to create this win-win situation? To me it's quite simple::

1. Striving for total honesty and transparency.
2. Speaking about the book only in places where people could be interested by the book.
3. Treating people like individual human beings, not a mass of numbers only there to bring some good old money.

What ways can we take to achieve that? To me, newsletters is the answer.

## Discoverability Source

Why using a newsletter when you have Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and the best of all, MySpace? There are multiple reasons:

1. I came to hate most social media. I have no control over it, and it's an insane grind to get enough followers to make the whole exercise worth it.
2. Algorithms are tuned for negativity. If it's not, well, I imagine things, but my experience stays the same. I don't learn anything reading walls of posts full of weird opinions disguised as truths, except a weird sensation of end of the world. When I want that, I play Fallout. It's more fun.
3. I can personally answer to people who write back. This is the most important to me, because I believe that we have to learn from each others. I wouldn't say that it create friendships; but it creates interesting discussions full of interesting experience. It's interesting, if you didn't understand.

Getting more money from sale is just a happy side effect. My aim is to help, to learn, and to have a good time. I try to make it a reality for this book, and in my life in general. I'm feel better that way; I'm happier that way. Simple as that.

So, how people can find my newsletter? In many ways, this book is an extension of my blog; they share the same aim: helping. The best way for people to end up on my blog is by searching an answer to their problems via search engine, like... Bing. When you think about it, Bing should have won the search engine war; not because it's good, but because it would be cool to say "Did you Bing it?".

Well, it would be very weird in fact. They could have thought about another name, seriously.

Anyway. So, hold and behold, the first step of discoverability I have is SEO. I'm the kind of guy who optimizes to have his blog on the first place of the first page of the first search engine. And since, to me at least, SEO is a deeply boring subject when you try to game it, I don't try to. Concerning my blog, I just mostly write about what I think is important, and try to bring the quality in. I do quick research to see if it would rank, look at the competitor, adjust the wording a bit (being very careful not loosing anything from it), and that's basically that.

It works well enough. I've a couple of first result, at least the last time I looked at it. I don't do that often.

And when people like my blog articles, they might subscribe to my newsletter. They might click on the "Book" entry in my menu and be interested by it. The most important: they decide. There won't be any ad to distract them, or anything I try to push. They are the masters of their destinies.

## The Release Day

Now that I've explaining my concept of "marketing" and the foundation of it for my own "business", let's speak about the launch.

I didn't do any kind of promotion for the release day. It's considered an important day, because it allows to create momentum. The more people hear about the book, the more they could recommend it to their peers, or at least speak to it. It's another good way for people to discover what you're doing when you don't have billion of dollar to annoy the whole human race.
