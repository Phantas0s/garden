<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like it, but the previous posts of my series were about important stuff: the stuff we have in our head. The stuff which define our reality. Let&rsquo;s explore now the writing itself. What was the crazy strategy I came up with to write this book?</p>
<h2 id="a-book-is-a-big-thing">A Book is a Big Thing</h2>
<p>Writing a book is not a walk in the park. It&rsquo;s because a book is big. Hundreds of pages, sometimes thousands! How on Earth can somebody writes that much? Many (more talented) people did it before me, so there are some ways.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s also big? A cathedral. Let&rsquo;s argue that it&rsquo;s even bigger than a book. Why the hell I&rsquo;m speaking about a cathedral? Because of this story:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re walking on a street made of chocolate and, suddenly, you meet three stonemasons. They all do the same work, building a nice cathedral. You ask each of them, one after another, what on Earth they&rsquo;re doing and why they&rsquo;re not relaxing and eating some pieces of the road.</p>
<p>The first one answer: &ldquo;I am cutting this stone to shape&rdquo;.
The second one answer: &ldquo;I am building a great cathedral&rdquo;.
The third one answer: &ldquo;I am working for the glory of God&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All three are right, and they do need to do all three to get the cathedral right:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first builder work on the necessary details to build the cathedral itself.</li>
<li>The second one look at the big picture, to be sure they indeed end up with a cathedral, and not with a rocket launcher.</li>
<li>The third one has the higher goal in mind, the big purpose. Who wants to build a big stuff (like a cathedral) if it has no purpose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Replace the word &ldquo;cathedral&rdquo; with &ldquo;books&rdquo; and you have the overall strategy. I wasn&rsquo;t working for the glory of God, but the glory of Vim and The Shell, which is more or less the same.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the real difficulty: I had to think about all three points more or less <em>at the same time</em>. I&rsquo;m alone, so I needed to. You need to cram all our three builders in your brain.</p>
<p>As much as possible, at least.</p>
<h2 id="what-tools-to-build-a-book">What Tools to Build a Book?</h2>
<p>At the time our three good builders were building the cathedral, they didn&rsquo;t really have a massive choice of tools. Or maybe they did; I don&rsquo;t know, I never built a cathedral.</p>
<p>There are many tools available to write a book nowadays. But the theme of this specific book is important here. It&rsquo;s Building your Mouseless Development Environment, you remember? An obscure stuff about Linux, the shell, the command line, and keyboards.</p>
<p>Would it be really honest to write the book using Windows 11 and Microsoft Word, using this damn mouse 98% of the time, without even opening a Linux shell? Not really, right? I like to be honest. It&rsquo;s easier to manage. Also, historically, I hate Word. And Windows. They inflicted too much pain to my little heart over the years.</p>
<p>I went all in: I built a whole CLI pipeline using the shell (Zsh) to convert markdown to PDF, with a little detour via LaTeX, featuring:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pandoc, to convert markdown to LaTeX, and markdown to HTML.</li>
<li>A bunch of Pandoc scripts (in Lua), to modify the AST created by pandoc, and spit the LaTeX and HTML I wanted.</li>
<li>latexmk, to convert from LaTeX to PDF.</li>
<li>ebook-convert, to convert from HTML to epub.</li>
</ol>
<p>These were the artists. Like any good orchestra, however, you also need a good conductor, and a fantastic composer:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>A makefile as the conductor, to orchestrate all these CLIs.</li>
<li>Neovim as the editor, to compose my delightful prose.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the different files in this <a href="https://github.com/Phantas0s/mouseless-book-behind-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github repo</a>. It changed quite a bit since then (I made many modifications while working on my <a href="https://themouseless.dev/vim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second book</a>) but the main ideas where already there.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know most of these tools at the beginning. I was a beginner builder. But I knew good old Arch Linux, Neovim, and the Linux shell fairly well. It was enough to learn easily the rest quite easily.</p>
<p>This workflow allowed me to control granularly every step, to do exactly what I wanted. I could control the details. It&rsquo;s different from having a software doing everything, without letting much control.</p>
<p>This control has a price, however: it&rsquo;s more difficult to set up. A little price in my opinion, because the power of such workflow is way bigger than any easier, &ldquo;bundled&rdquo; solution.</p>
<h2 id="experiments-and-iterations">Experiments and Iterations</h2>
<p>As I was saying, I was one builder on this book, so I had to keep in mind as much as possible the details, the whole, and the purpose. Here&rsquo;s my usual workflow when I do something new, and building this book wasn&rsquo;t an exception:</p>
<ol>
<li>Experiment (details).</li>
<li>Look at what happens (details / whole).</li>
<li>Analyze the feedback: see if I wanted to keep or reject the results (whole).</li>
<li>Ask for external feedback about the decisions made (purpose).</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to see if my book would achieve its purpose for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was too much &ldquo;in it&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t have any objectivity on the &ldquo;educative power&rdquo; of the book.</li>
<li>I knew enough what I was talking about to write a book. But it&rsquo;s difficult to know how the readers would react to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s why external feedback were important. I was trying to teach something with this book, and the only ones who could tell me if it was successful were the potentials learners themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get feedback. People are busy, and I totally get that. I&rsquo;m busy, too! And I&rsquo;m part of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; for others&rsquo; projects also. But, thanks to my blog and the surrounding community, I could gather enough feedback to get some directions and fix some problematic areas.</p>
<p>If I need to do it all over again, I&rsquo;d use the same approach. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m doing with <a href="https://themouseless.dev/vim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my new book</a>!</p>
