<p>Still here for the third part of my rambling about the book I&rsquo;ve written, <a href="https://themouseless.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Your Mouseless Development Environment</a>? You&rsquo;re not only courageous, but you also have a lot of patience. You&rsquo;ll go far in life, my friend.</p>
<h2 id="the-million-dollar-idea">The Million Dollar Idea</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s end 2019. We were all young and innocent at the time, full of hope and dreams.</p>
<p>At that point, my development environment was entirely based on Arch Linux (by the way). My whole software development workflow was centered around the Linux shell. Let&rsquo;s call it my Mouseless Development Environment. With capital letters, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s my baby, you know.</p>
<p>Before that, I used Windows (from 98 to 7), Ubuntu, Peppermint (a Linux distro based on Ubuntu), other Linux distro I forgot the names, and even MacOS.</p>
<p>When some colleagues showed me the power of this Mouseless Development Environment, I didn&rsquo;t believe that they could work with these horrible, old, and unpractical stuff. Then, I tried it. Seriously tried it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hooked since then.</p>
<p>So, end of 2019, I had an idea. I asked on the Holy Reddit: &ldquo;Hey brothers! Peace to you all! Is anybody interested to have a book describing how to create this Mouseless Development Environment, based on Arch Linux, Zsh, Vim, and Tmux?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer: a big YES. It was easy, I was on the &ldquo;command line&rdquo; subreddit. To me, it was enough. I&rsquo;ll write this book!</p>
<h2 id="travelling">Travelling</h2>
<p>I was speaking about dreams earlier. My biggest one at the time: travelling in Asia. For months.</p>
<p>If I stay at home, I&rsquo;ll work on my 12093210879123 side projects, focused like a laser. Travelling is the only thing which push me to unfocus, to get creative again. But the most important: I love travelling, I love Asia, and I love to love. I could write a whole poem about it, but I think I shouldn&rsquo;t, for humanity&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>We came up with a plan, my girlfriend and me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit our jobs.</li>
<li>Go backpacking in Asia for 4 to 6 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>I planned to write the book when I&rsquo;d come back.</p>
<p>We left Berlin, where we live, in January 2020, and you know what comes next: our good old friend COVID hit. Hard.</p>
<h2 id="pandemic">Pandemic!</h2>
<p>We decided to come back in March 2020, because of the pandemic. All the borders in Europe were closing at that point. The only problem: we didn&rsquo;t have a flat in Berlin anymore, because we were subleasing it till June.</p>
<p>We managed, somehow, to find a temporary place to live for a few months. It&rsquo;s not like you can get a flat in Berlin super easily; we were lucky.</p>
<p>No job, no way to finish our travel, no way to come back to our flat, with only my immortal Lenovo x220 laptop I was carrying around in Asia, some clothes, and a COVID which could kill us all. That was my situation beginning 2020.</p>
<p>What a great time to write a book!</p>
<p>First, I had to decide what tools I&rsquo;d used to build the book itself. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vim</li>
<li>Pandoc</li>
<li>Make</li>
</ul>
<p>I knew Vim, not so much Pandoc, even less Make, and I had no idea about Latex. I could have written the entire book in Markdown, but since I like to shape everything according to my craziest megalomaniac desires, I had to scribble some Latex, and more than once.</p>
<p>But I could do everything in my shell, and that&rsquo;s what matter. Gimme a shell and I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;m on a computer for a long time. Okay, time is relative, but still. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to have a first setup to create a PDF, an EPUB, and even an HTML in one command line. BAM!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to know everything. There is too much stuff. But I try to be able to learn anything quickly. It&rsquo;s the whole goal of The Valuable Dev, too.</p>
<p>Anyway. That was the birth of my book!</p>
<h2 id="luck-luck-luck-and-success">Luck, Luck, Luck, and Success</h2>
<p>All and all, I was incredibly lucky.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t alone, we found a flat quickly when we <strong>had to</strong> (I never saw such a mess in airports, with so many flight cancelled), I didn&rsquo;t get COVID to this day (as far as I know), I could keep a positive spirit enabling me to write a book in a dark period, I&rsquo;m living in a rich country, and I&rsquo;m a privileged white male. It&rsquo;s not winning a lottery, it&rsquo;s winning a dozen of them.</p>
<p>I take that as a success.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s success? Mostly luck. Of course, luck can be slightly helped: I love what I&rsquo;m doing, so I do it long enough to get some fruits from the tree.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between my rational thinking above and my feelings. These freaking emotions do whatever the hell they want in my weird brain. I didn&rsquo;t let them take over, however, and that&rsquo;s what really mattered. Years of meditation help. It can help you too. Or something else. Find what help you.</p>
<p>You know. Try. Experiment. Fail. Learn. Try again.</p>
<p>Or just relax. We need to relax, sometimes. For me, it&rsquo;s travelling, or writing, or listening to a good vinyl. For you, it might be something else. Be sure it makes you unfocus, though. We can&rsquo;t spend our time obsessed by what we want. By our goals. We <strong>need</strong> to unplug. To plug better afterward. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to plug better?</p>
<p>The western world is so crazy with its quest of results, success, hustling, and productivity. Let&rsquo;s not forget: enjoying the way, focusing on higher goals, wondering, relaxing. Creating something without any expectations. Helping without expectations.</p>
<p>Relaxing might not be the direct way to achieve what we want, but indirect ways are often the best ways. Life is about the way, anyway. Whatever we do, we&rsquo;ll try to do better, anyway. We&rsquo;ll try another way. Way, way, way.</p>
<p>The way is a balance. A balance with enough productivity to make you happy, and enough relaxation to make you happy. Be happy! Now!</p>
<p>If it sounds too complicated, you can buy a hundred of my books and see if it gives you happiness. You can&rsquo;t tell if you don&rsquo;t try! Ah! The Ultimate Marketing Strategy™.</p>
<p>Did I have some expectation for this book? One: I would be happy if it would help somebody.</p>
<p>My expectations were blown away hundred of times. Low, honest expectations always win.</p>
<p>Is it success, then?</p>
