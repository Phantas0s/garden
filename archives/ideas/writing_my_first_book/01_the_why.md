## Introduction

* Release the Physical version of the book
* Time for me to come back at the beginning of the journey
* I'll tell you Everything
* When you see a book, you might think that it was made like that and published
    * A lot more of work, thoughts, and in genreal context than taht
    * This is what I'd like to speak about in this article: context
* If you want to know the technical details to put the book together, go at this section
* For publishing a printed book, go to this section

## Why Did I Write a Book

* This is the emotional section nobody care
* Everything began when I was 10: I always wanted to write a book!
    * Granted, at the time, it was more of a ripoff of the lord of the ring
* Since I know how to write, I never stopped.

### The Valuable Dev

* Fascinated by writing and computers since I'm this age
    * So I've been writing about... software development for a while
    * Not everything is on the net
* Beginning The Valuable Dev, which was my first and long going serious side project
    * a kind-of blog with long ass content I wanted to be detailed and researched as much as possible
    * about timeless principles, as opposition to trendy stuff out there without presenting the big picture
* Taught me how to write in English
    * I've still many progresses to do
* Other than that, explaining is the best way to deepen your knowledge
    * To somebody or... by writing
    * Help you structure your thought
    * Writing is not about writing per say (part of), it's about your thoughts
        * The meaning of what you want to convey more than the words themselves
    * Share your knowledge to people who might like what you have to say, and how you say it
