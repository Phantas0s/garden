I don't know if you know, but I've written a book!

It's called [Building Your Mouseless Development Environment](https://themouseless.dev/). What? If I made a lot of money out of it? Well, not really. That was not the purpose, even if I'm happy to get some rework from my work. What was the purpose then?

Well, that's what I'll try to explore in this series of articles. Not only that: I'll speak about every aspects of this book, from the will to write a book to the publication.

I know, it's not incredible to write a whole book. Everybody does that nowadays. Write a hundred of lines, package it in a PDF, and BAM! you've a book. You can now put on your personal brand "New York Time Best Seller Author And Speaker And Writter And I Need Your Money Please".

It's still something I'm very proud of. That To write the book, I've been reading the return of experience of other authors, and it inspired me greatly.

I'll try to bring my own experience, also to inform and inspire the author who might sleep deep inside.

Here's the complete series:
