Vim:

* I can customize everything for my own needs. I like flexible tools.
* It fits very well to my mouseless workflow (keeping my hands on my keyboard to avoid the cognitive burden to switch between keyboard / mouse).
* The community is great. There are so many plugins out there!
* Easy to learn, hard to master. I love improving with my tools, because you become very effective that way.
* It's fun. Trying to do as less keystrokes as possible is the gamification of typing.
* Its interface with the shell is awesome. You can basically use all the CLIs you want with Vim.
* Like with the shell, you can automate so much stuff, it's insane. You repeat always the same editing, something like "put some parenthesis around a link and then put some square bracket before with the title of the link inside"? You can record the series of keystroke and repeat it with every link you want.

I could continue like that all day ðŸ¥°
