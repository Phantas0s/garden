People like Steve McConnel compared development as building houses or bridge. There are two main differences with these activities, however: software development is not limited to the raw material we have (in our case, it's unlimited), that's why many people out there think that we can do everything and anything with some code. The second difference has more dire consequences: the codebase *and its environment* evolve way quicker that the structure of a building, and a little change in the tech environment (like discovering a new exploit in one of the library you're using) can increase drastically the complexity or even pull the whole thing down.

As such, as often see software development as a garden: it's more fragile than a building. We need to constantly pull the bad weed out (refactoring), be cautious of bad sickness spreading all over the codebase, bring enough care to make everything work as fast as we want. It's a living organism we cant really grasp in its entirety. Can we say it's a living system?
