1. This is waht I do for my organisation and worfklow
2. You know what's the best part? Screw all of this. If you want to work freely with a beer at end, full of cookies, do it; it's your life, your universe. You can invent all the possibilities, you can create all the ideas you want. Don't follow the ones who want to impose you the *good* ways of doing. They'll only limit your creativity.

Our biggest barriers are the ones we create for ourselves. Let's experiment, innovate, invent. Let's be free.
