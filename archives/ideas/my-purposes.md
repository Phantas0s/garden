+++

I have purposes in my life, and I would like most of my time dedicated to these purposes.

But I still need to work for companies who are only thinking about making money (most of the time) because, you know, I still have to pay the bills.

So I would love to reduce the time I work for these companies and work to achieve my purposes, if possible with other people sharing them.

I consider myself very blessed, because I'm living in a rich country, I have skills which are in high demands, I have friends, a family, and a lot of support. I don't want much more in my life, that's why I'm very eager to help the ones who are not that lucky.

And more I help, more I feel happy. And more I feel happy, more I want to help. 

I want to improve the world as much as I can. I want to share all my knowledge for people who needs it. That's my goals.
