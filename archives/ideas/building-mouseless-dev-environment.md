## Introduction

* Release the Physical version of the book
* Time for me to come back at the beginning of the journey
* I'll tell you Everything
* When you see a book, you might think that it was made like that and published
    * A lot more of work, thoughts, and in genreal context than taht
    * This is what I'd like to speak about in this article: context
* If you want to know the technical details to put the book together, go at this section
* For publishing a printed book, go to this section

## Why Did I Write a Book

* This is the emotional section nobody care
* Everything began when I was 10: I always wanted to write a book!
    * Granted, at the time, it was more of a ripoff of the lord of the ring
* Since I know how to write, I never stopped.

### The Valuable Dev

* Fascinated by writing and computers since I'm this age
    * So I've been writing about... software development for a while
    * Not everything is on the net
* Beginning The Valuable Dev, which was my first and long going serious side project
    * a kind-of blog with long ass content I wanted to be detailed and researched as much as possible
    * about timeless principles, as opposition to trendy stuff out there without presenting the big picture
* Taught me how to write in English
    * I've still many progresses to do
* Other than that, explaining is the best way to deepen your knowledge
    * To somebody or... by writing
    * Help you structure your thought
    * Writing is not about writing per say (part of), it's about your thoughts
        * The meaning of what you want to convey more than the words themselves
    * Share your knowledge to people who might like what you have to say, and how you say it

### The Idea for the Book

* First, I've been initiated to only using the terminal as a developer, and using as minimal tool as possible to be more efficient
    * Big point which really improve my life: using my keyboard as much as possible!
    * Naturally, I wanted to share the knowledge for others to experiment by themselves
* One thing leading to another, I've been written a couple of article on TVD which reasonates with people
* SO I ask on Reddit in 2019: hey guys, do you want to see a book about Mouseless dev env?
    * The response was positive
    * But I was working full time at the time, I was writing for TVD and I had other side projects (link to my Github) so I couldn't

### Covid-19

* Wanted to travel
* In the middle of it, Covid hit
* Had to come back
    * No job
    * No flat
    * Mess, but I managed very well at that time to get somewhere to live
* Positive: A LOT OF FREE TIME
    * Decided to write the book!

## How Did I write the book

### Writing

* I've written a couple of hours everyday
* The most important about writing is not writing, but put out the idea
* Was reading a lot of material about writing
    * the best would be the book keys to great writing
    * Read many blog of self-published writers too (see reference)
* I've a whole system I've described here, mostly based on pomodoro
    * How much pomodoro I want to do on each projects I have

### Putting the Book Together

* I love CLI so I used the following tools:
    * Neovim
    * pandoc with some lua filters
    * a makefile
* Took me a long time to format it as I wanted
    * I had no idea about Latex at that point
    * Trial and errors

## How Could One Find the Book?

### The Release

* On Flurly
    * Young platform I wanted to help
    * The author is responsive and very nice
    * Most part of the royalty directly to me
* Released on:
    * Reddit
    * Hacker News (it made the first page!)
    * Linkedin
    * Twitter

### Make the book available

* THe first step: how people who can be interested by the book can find it?
    * Often called "marketing", but what people think when thinking about marketing is mostly bad marketing
    * I prefer thinking in term of: how people who would be interested by the book can find it?
    * I wrote the book to be useful, I don't want to push it to the throat of people who wouldn't like it

* Speak about it in my newsletter for The Valuable Dev
* Added the mention on the website itself and some discrete mentions of it on different articles
    * I knew that people who liked my artiles about mouseless could be interested
    * I tried to do it in a non-intrusive way
        * No pop-ups! I hate popups.
* Begs the question: how people can find my artiles?
    * Some SEO, but keeping in mind that I didn't want to change the content or the "spirit" of the articles for SEO
        * No clickbait but simple titles
        * Didn't want to stick to the "trend" of the moment
* Some republishing of article on Dev.to
* Wrote
* "build in public" approach with a dedicated newsletter where I was given some update of the advancement of the book

### The Updates

* I've been then working on the book on and off, adding three updates to it
    * New chapter
    * New annexe section
    * Many fixes from the reader feedback

### One Year Later

* 530 bought it
* Nobody asked for a refund
* Many asked for advice I was happy to provide
* To me, it was a success
    * Many people sold more than me
    * ... it doesn't matter. I've been in contact with great people
    * ... and I know I helped many of them with this book!

## The Printed version

* Began to work on it in 2020
* I've read a lot about what include making a printed version
* Needed to design my cover and create a PDF
    * Why not using a designer?
        * Yeah it would have maybe bring more sales but... it's less fun!
        * I loved the process all the way and I think it's key for doing something which trully fullfill you
* Many asked me for a physical book, so I wanted to tackle that

* Needed a ISBN
    * In germany, they cost a shitlot
* Used Ingramspark
    * At the end, cost me around 200 because of revisions and shit
    * Describe the whole story

## Numbers

* Because humans seem fascinated with numbers, here are some:
    * pomodoro
    * flurly
    * ...

## The Adventure Continue

* I'm already writing my next book, Learning to Play Vim
    * There are a lot of books about Vim already, but I want something different
    * ...as a result very ambitious project
* I still test the script I explain in the book every month to be sure everything works as expected
