## Why am I collecting Vinyls?

I really love music. I'm listening to many things, even if everything's rooted into hard rock - heavy metal. Here are the bands I always go back too, for many, many years.

### Why Vinyl Thought?

* There is a "touchy" feeling not everybody will experience - but I do. My weird brain like stuff in real life (it goes again the "let's upload our brain in a computer it would be so cool" trend).
* There is the artwork
* I give money to the people who really make a difference in my life.
    * Art is fucking important. It's not only something beautiful, it's staring in the soul of another human being
    * AI generated art: there is no story behind it. It's a mechanism which makes it. Human are mechanism too arguably, but I'm one of them. I'm not an AI (which is not that intelligent, by the way).

### Classic

* Very formatter. Showed me that subtleties has a lot going on.
* Big fan of Mozart
